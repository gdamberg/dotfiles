Run maven commands via a Node JS API!

## Usage

To create the maven handler, you need to call the create method providing the path to the POM file to be handled.

```
var mvn = require('node-maven-api').create('/workspace/project/pom.xml');

mvn.clean();
mvn.install();
```

### Clean

Invoke a maven clean on your project.

```
mvn.clean();
```

### Install

Invoke a maven install on your project.

```
mvn.install();
```

### Test

Invoke a maven test on your project.

```
mvn.test();
```

### Effective pom

Get the effective pom for your project.  A promise will be returned which will be resolved to a javascript object which represents the xml effective pom.

```
var promise = mvn.effectivePom();

promise.then((result) => {
    console.log('Effective POM is: ', result);
});
```

### Custom Command

The API provided by this module can not possibly cover every maven goal, there is far too many!  You can run any command you need with the execCommand function.

```
// mvn clean install -f /path/to/my/pom.xml
mvn.execCommand('clean install');
```
