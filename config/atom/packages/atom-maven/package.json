Please ensure that Apache Maven is correctly installed on your computer and is ready to use on the command line.\n\nPlease see the Maven website for [installation instructions](http://maven.apache.org/install.html).\n\n## What's new in version 1.0.0\nThe atom-maven package is a lot lazier in the new release, relying on your Maven installation to do all the hard work, rather than trying to replicate everything that Maven does.  In doing this, a lot of the features I wanted to implement I got for free.  \n\nCheckout the [changelog](https://github.com/concon121/atom-maven/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of recently implemented features and bug fixes.\n\n## Backlog and Issues\nThe complete list of features which needs to be implemented, future enhancements, known issues and bugs can be found on the atom-maven GitHub repository [issues page](https://github.com/concon121/atom-maven/issues).\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are always welcome, there is still a lot of work to be done!  Feel free to pick up an issue in the backlog and open a pull request to get the conversation going.  I am more than happy to provide help and direction, and very welcoming of advice and suggestions.\n\n## Raising Issues\n\nIf atom-maven is not resolving your classpath correctly, it is really useful for debugging purposes if you could provide sample pom files which I can use to reproduce your issue.\n\n## What can I use atom-maven for?\n\nI started developing atom-maven as I wanted to be able to write my Java code in Atom.  There are a couple of packages I found which make this easier, but they depend on a .classpath file being configured.  As a user of Maven, Maven configures your classpath and makes sure all your dependencies are available when you need them to be.  The atom-maven package replicates this functionality and generates the .classpath file other Atom Java packages need, based on your Maven pom files!   \n\n### Useful Java Packages\n\n* [autocomplete-java](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-java)\n* [linter-javac](https://atom.io/packages/linter-javac)\n\n#### autocomplete-java\nCapable of reading the generated .classpath file, this package provides functionlity to organise imports, complete packages and classes, examine methods etc...\n\nNote. git ignored .classpath files are not discovered.\n\n#### linter-javac\nCapable of reading the generated .classpath file, this package will attempt to compile your .java files and show you all the compile time problems with your code.\n\n## Kudos\nKudos to the following, for making my life easier!\n\n* [node-maven-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-maven-api)\n* [atom-message-panel](https://github.com/tcarlsen/atom-message-panel)\n* [xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js)\n",
